# Introduction
The blockchain technology acts as a foundation for
distributed ledgers and an innovative platform for a new decentralized and transparent transaction mechanism in industries
and businesses is offered by it. Supply chain traceability is
impacted by growing consumer awareness and manufacturers internal quality requirements. When multiple parties are involved,
existing centralized solutions suffer from isolated data storage
and lacking trust. Decentralized blockchain-based approaches
facilitate to forestall these issues by making digital representations of physical goods to facilitate tracking across multiple
entities. The potential advantage of this emerging technology in
manufacturing supply chain is then discussed and a vision for the
future blockchain ready large scale manufacturing supply chain
is proposed. Ultimately, a discussion of the requirements and
challenges to adopt this technology in the future manufacturing
systems is done.
